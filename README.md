Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Data is fed to the machines, and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand. Machine Learning is used in many areas from automating mundane tasks to offering intelligent industries in every sector to try to benefit from it.

Prediction :- Machine learning can also be used in prediction systems. Considering the loan example, to compute the probability of a fault, the system will need to classify the available data in groups.

Image recognition and Speech Recognition  :- Machine learning can be used for face detection in an image as well. There is a separate category for each person in a database of several people. Speech Recognition is the translation of spoken words into the text. It is used in voice searches and more. Voice user interfaces include voice dialing, call routing, and appliance control. It can also be used for simple data entry and the preparation of structured documents.

Medical diagnoses — ML is trained to recognize cancerous tissues.

Financial industry and trading — companies use ML in fraud investigations and credit checks. [“1”]

In the project we have discussed how with machine learning we can build an image classifier which can be used for different purposes.

Classification is a systematic arrangement in groups and categories based on its features. Image classification is a fundamental task that attempts to comprehend an entire image as whole. The project objective is basically to classify images on different categories based on deep learning based neural networks .The image classification is achieved by distinguishing the images in a dataset into the prescribed category based on the content of the vision. 

The conventional methods used for image classifying are part and piece of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) formally called machine learning. Machine learning consists of a feature extraction module that extracts the important features such as edges, textures etc and a classification module that classifies based on the features extracted.
 
The objective of image classification in general  is to identify and portray, as a unique gray level(or color), the features occurring in an image in terms of the object or type of land cover these features actually represent on the ground. There are lots of image classification techniques and algorithms . We haved used convolutional neural networks(CNN)  to create models. 
 
CNN is a special architecture of artificial neural networks. CNNs use some of its features of visual cortex and have therefore achieved state of the art results in computer vision tasks.
 
Convolutional neural networks are composed of two very simple elements, namely convolutional layers and pooling layers as shown in the figure 1. Most of the time pooling layers are followed by fully connected layers and dropout layers. Although simple, there are near-infinite ways to arrange these layers for a given computer vision problem.

CNNs are used in various fields. There is a wide range of applications of CNNs like facial recognition softwares,image classifier etc. Few are listed below:-
 
Decoding Facial Recognition :- Facial recognition is broken down by a convolutional neural network into the following major components -  Identifying every face in the picture; Focusing on each face despite external factors, such as light, angle, pose, etc. Identifying unique features Comparing all the collected data with already existing data in the database to match a face with a name.
 
Analyzing Documents:- Convolutional neural networks can also be used for document analysis. This is not just useful for handwriting analysis, but also has a major stake in recognizers. For a machine to be able to scan an individual's writing, and then compare that to the wide database it has, it must execute almost a million commands a minute. 




Historic and Environmental Collections:-CNNs are also used for more complex purposes such as natural history collections. These collections act as key players in documenting major parts of history such as biodiversity, evolution, habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change.

Understanding Climate:-ML can be used to play a major role in the fight against climate change, especially in understanding the reasons why we see such drastic changes and how we could experiment in curbing the effect. [“3”]
 

For the project, we have used 2 image-based datasets. One of the datasets contains different images of flowers that belong to different classes. Another dataset contains cell images which are classified into two groups: uninfected and infected cells images.
 
 
The coding is purely python based. Various python libraries were used. Tensorflow and Keras were used to develop the whole model. Google colab and Jupyter Notebook is used as a text-editor.  
 
 
Data is the lifeblood of all business. Data-driven decisions increasingly make the difference between keeping up with competition or falling further behind. Machine learning can be the key to unlocking the value of corporate and customer data and enacting decisions that keep a company ahead of the competition. [“4”]
